#**Badbank Application**

This is an Insecure server Banking app that was developed as part of the MERN full-stack developer certification program at MIT xPro.

#Motivation

This project was born out of my desire to learn how to design a complete 3-tier application, and it will continue to evolve as my understanding of application development expands. It's also intended to be a simple way for me to demonstrate what I've learnt in my Master's in Full Stack Development degree.
